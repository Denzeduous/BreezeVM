# What is BreezeVM?
The Breeze Virtual Machine (BreezeVM or BVM) is a process virtual machine for a custom bytecode and instruction set (BVMAsm), similar to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). BreezeVM's bytecode (Breeze Bytecode, or BBC) is type-agnostic to natively support dynamically-typed languages.

Due to a compiler bug in Odin that invalidated the previous project, this project was quickly designed and developed in a month to meet the capstone's due date. Due to this, tests are severely lacking, as well as the implemented instructions.

|       Sprawl      | Sprawl is a library built for indexing n-dimensional arrays without indirection. Rather than building arrays of arrays, Sprawl builds a contiguous array, using an algorithm to index it. Currently, it is O(n − 2)<sup>2</sup>, but can be optimized to O(n − 2). |                      Odin                      | [https://github.com/F0x1fy/odin-sprawl](https://github.com/F0x1fy/odin-sprawl) |

|    Maze Solver    | For our Algorithms and Data Structures class, we had to create a maze solver that would traverse around walls to find the shortest path to the end.
